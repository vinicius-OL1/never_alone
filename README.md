# never_alone
a mini project that aims to bring greater social interaction to the social environment of the UFMS university.
The idea came soon after a publication on the university's website about the yellow September, and in my perspective the increase in social interaction would help to minimize the cases of suicide that occur.
any questions about the project or bug reports send them at [@vinycius_0l](https://www.instagram.com/vinycius_0l/)
