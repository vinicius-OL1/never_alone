# never_alone
a mini project that aims to bring greater social interaction to the social environment of the UFMS university.
The idea came soon after a publication on the university's website about the yellow September, and in my perspective the increase in social interaction would help to minimize the cases of suicide that occur.
any questions about the project or bug reports send them at [@vinycius_0l](https://www.instagram.com/vinycius_0l/)

# how to use
first check if you have python 3 installed
if not, just run  
~~~javascript
-sudo apt-get install python3
~~~
also check if the json and request library is installed

### how it works
Because it is in a testing state, there are still only 3 options,
Firstly, it is necessary to register, with name, email and number so that you can search for other users, when registering it is possible to do the draw to find a profile, when doing so the registration information of the other user will appear.
for now these are just these features, after the draw the hope is that the user will seek to help the person drawn and demonstrate that they really are not alone
